# Library-_Banking-_Stocks_Management_systems_CPP
The following are three separate cpp files for a library management system, a banking management system and a investors management system using OOP concepts on terminal.

Libraray Management system:
This Library Management System consists of multiple classes such as User, Librarian, Book, Page, Account, Library database, Staff, and Student. The classes have attributes such as UserType, UserName, Password, Name, ID, Title, Author, ISBN, no_borrowed_books, no_lost_books, no_reserved_books, fine_amount, Dept, and Batch. They also have member functions including constructors, getters and setters, login, register, verify_librarian, search_book, show_due_date, reservation_status, book_request, renew_info, calculate_fine, add, delete, update, display, search, verify, check_account, and get_book_info.

The Library Management System allows an admin to create a new Librarian, who can log in and add books to the Library database. Students and Staff members can issue books, with different due dates. The system also allows for book returns and displays fines for late returns. The Library database can be updated with book status and user information.

Banking System:
The management system is designed for a bank and will be used by bank employees. It records detailed information of account holders including their name, address, telephone number, date of birth, and CNIC number, and allocates a unique account number to each account holder. There are two types of accounts: checking and saving, with different interest rates and service charges. Credit cards are also available with unique numbers and varying interest rates and limits. The system includes a main menu for bank employees to perform operations such as creating new accounts, withdrawing and depositing money, checking balances, generating transaction histories, and more.

Investors Management System:
This program is designed for investors to manage their investments in assets, which can be stocks, real estate, or currency. Stocks can be simple or dividend, with attributes including symbol, total shares, total cost, and current price. Dividend stocks have an additional feature of dividends. Real estate assets have attributes including location, area, year of purchase, cost, and current market value. Currency assets have only the amount the investor has.

All assets have market value computed using current price and will return the profit accumulated by the asset, which is the difference between the current value and original cost. The program allows investors to add and subtract assets and compute the profit and current value of each asset. It also allows investors to find the most profitable assets among all the assets they hold.
